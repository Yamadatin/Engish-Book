Introduction
Dancing was the one good thing in my life. I wasn't cleve or popular at school, but I could dance.
Jackie Elliot lives in a small coastal town in the north of England with his two sons, Tony and Billy. Life is hard for the faily. Jakie and Tony are fighting their employers and they are not working. They have no money and Jackie is worried about the future. He is worried about Billy too...
Eleven-year-old Bily Elliot is different from other boys. He is not very clever or good at sport. Then, one day, he discovers ballet dancing. Finally he has found something that he can do well. But everybody knowns that ballet is forgirls, not boys! Will Billy continue to dance? Or will Jackie and Tony stop him?
Billy Elliot is a film by Stephen Daldry, starring Jamie Bell as BIlly, Gary Lewis as his father and Julie Walters as Mrs Wilkinson. The film was written by Lee Hall, and then rewritten as a book by Melvin Burgess.
The story begins in 1984, when many British workers were fighting the government. Margaret Thtcher's government wanted to close a lot of coal mines in England, Wales and Scotland. The miners wanted to keep their jobs. Some went on strike and refused to work. Other workers continued to do their jobs. The government had to send the police to protect them. The strike continued for a long time before everybody went back to work. But a few years later, nearly all the coal mines in the UK were closed and thousands of workers lost their jobs.
Billy Elliot was a very successful film in many contries across the world. It is now also a musical play, with songs by Sir Elton John.

Chapter 1 BIlly's Story: Family Life
My brother Tony is stupid, but he likes good music. I listen to his records before school when he and my dad are out on the picket line. My grandmother - we call her Nan - likes the music too. I play the music and she sits in bed and sings. Sometimes we dance around the room She's nearly eighty and she can't walk far. But she lifts her arms up in the air and tries to stand on one leg like a ballet dancer.
Dad and Tony don't like it when she dances. They think it's stupid. But I want her to dance and sing all day.
This morning I made her breakfast and danced into her room.
"Hey, Nan, it's the dancing waiter," I said.
But she wasn't there!
I ran out of the door. My dad will kill me if I lose Nan. I raced up the road shouting, "Nan! Nan!"
Where was she? Was she on her way down to the sea? You can see the sea from our house and she goes there sopmetimes. But little Alison, one of the neighbour's children, pointed up the street.
Suddenly I knew: Nan was in the field under the railway bridge. She often goes there. Nobody knows why. Maybe she played there when she was a child.
"Nan!" I shouted.
She turned and looked at me. I pused through the long wet grass. Poor Nan, she was wet and frightened.
"I don't know where I am," she said.
"Don't you want your eggs?" I said.
"You're new," she said.
"Nan, it's Billy. Billy."
Three vans stopped near the railway bridge and lots of policemen climbed out. Theyfrightened me. Nan looked at them.
"What are they?" she said.
"Police, Nan. It's the police."
"I hate them!" she shouted. She waved her arms at them.
Some of them looked at us, but they didn't come down.
"Have they come for us, Billy? she whispered. She knows about the police. She knows that they're not on our side.
"Not us, Nan. They're not interested in us."
"Is it Jackie? Is it Tony?" she asked.
I didn't answer. I took her arm and we walked home.
The next day, I was playing a song on the piano and thinking about Mum. Tony was eating and Dad was washing the dishes. Nan was sitting on her bed, singing.
Mum died two years ago. I don't think anyone remembers her except me. I miss her, I miss her every day. I miss her when I'm walking through the house. I miss her when I'm playing the piano.
I have a letter from my mum. She wrote it for my eighteenth birthday, but I opened it early.
"Dear BIlly..."
Can you hear? Can you hear my mum's voice?
Listen.
"Dear Billy, I didn't see you grow up. I missed you crying and laughing. I missed you shouting. But please know that I was always with you. I always will be. I am very proud of you. I am proud that you are my son. I love you very much."
I keep the letter in a box under my bed, I read it when nobody is in the room. Tony and I sleep in the same bedroom, and one night I read the letter to him. I wanted him to remember my mum with me, me and him together. But he didn't want to.
"Don't you miss her?" I asked him.
"Oh be quiet," he said angrily. Then he went to sleep.
I was playing the piano and thinking about Mum. She played the piano too. I can't really play. I'd like piano lessons but we haven't got enough money.
My dad and Tony don't have time to remember Mum. They're too busy on the picket line or down the mine. Fighting - always fighting. Fighting the government, fighting with the bosses. Fighting at home. Fighting me.
They were arguing again that morning.
"We must go, Dad! We'll be late!"
Tony pulled on his boots. But Dad wanted to make the house tidy. He doesn't like leaving Nan alone in the house.
"I have to make your nan's breakfast."
"Billy can do it. It's time to go!"
"Wait a minute," Dad said, and went outside. He came back in with some coal. "We haven't got much coal now," he said.
"The strike will end soon," Tony said. "We'll be back down the mine next month,"
"No we won't," Dad said.
Tony looked angrily at him. "You don't want to go on the picket line, do you?" he said. "You want to stay in bed."
"Tony..."Dad began.
"I'm not waiting for you," Tony said, and walked to the door.
"Tony! Tony, wait for me!" Dad shouted, but Tony was gone.
Dad didn't follow him. He stood and looked at the door. I played another song on the piano.
"Be quiet, Billy!" he shouted at me suddenly.
"Mum didn't mind," I said.
He came up behind me and closed the piano suddenly. He nearly broke my fingers. Then he ran out of the way out.
Oh no! I throught. Today I'm boxing. I hate it when he watches me.
"Listen. I boxed. My dad boxed. You box." That's my dad. I box because he and his father boxed. Every Saturday morning I put the gloves round my neck and go to the club. Then I try to break someone's head.
Boxing is OK. But I have my own ideas about it and they don't like that. They think boxing is about hitting people hard. They think it's about your hands, but it's not. It's about your feet.
"Don't move!" George, my boxing teacher, shouts. "Hit him! Hit him! Stop moving! Stop and fight!"
He doesn't understand. The other person gets tired if I dance round them. Then I can hit them. But George can't wait. Nobody can wait.

Cahpter2 Jackie's Story: The Boxing Club
I worry about Billy. I try to be a good father, but every boy needs a mother. And Billy's not an ordinary boy.
We're fighting now, for our future and for our town. It's a fight for my job and for Tony's job - but is it a fight for Billy? I know he's diffrent. Our Billy will never go down the mine and bring up the coal.
Everything has changed. My dad was on strike in the 1930s, but then the miners were important. Everybody needed coal because they've got oil and gas. And coal from Argentina is cheaper than English coal.
The government doesn't like us. The head of the government, already closed half the factories. Now she's closing the mines. At first, I thought we could stop her. Now I'm not sure.
Maybe Tony's right. Maybe I'm old and soft. I've lost almost everything. My lovely wife Sarah is dead. I've only got the boys and the strike. Life is hard, very, very hard. I stay on strike because of Tony. What will he do if the mines close? You can't be a miner without a mine. So here I am, fighting for Ony and for Billy. I've nothing to give them. No job. No mother. No future. Just me.
Every Saturday, I watch Billy box. I miss the beginning of the class because I'm on the picket likne. It's hard out there. We watch the scabs going into the mine in buses. Tony and some of the other young men want to hurt the scabs. They want blood. They shout it sometimes:"BLOOD! BLOOD! BLOOD!"
I don't agree with them. I don't want to hurt anyone. But I know why Tony's angry. We're fighting for the future, and those scabs are hiding behind the police. They're men that I worked with. They're men that I went to school with. They're my friends - and they're riding into the mine behind the police. We have to fight the bosses. We don't want to fight our friends too.
I went to the club on Saturday to watch my boy at his boxing class. I boxed when I was a boy. My dad boxed and Tony boxed too. Now Billy has boxing lessons. I tell him, "You must fight, boy. If you can't fight, people will hurt you."
There was a ballet class in the hall. It was full of little girls in pink dresses jumping up and down, up and down.
"Bottoms out!" called the ballet teacher.
Ballet and boxing, in the same place. I laughed. Put the little girls in boxing gloves and the boys in those pink shoes, I thought. That wil be funny!
Billy was in the boxing ring with another boy.
"Hit him, Billy!" I shouted. BIlly's getting better. He moves his feet well. "You move well," I said, "But hit him too!"
The other boy was taller and stronger than Billy, but he was fat. Billy will win easily, I thought. Then they started to fight...
What was Billy doing? He was dancing, turning in circles.
"Oh no," George said. "Not again. This isn't a tea party, it's a fight. Hit him! Hit him!"
He looked at me and I shook my head.
Billy was dancing round and round the boxing ring. The other boy stood there, watching.
"Watch him, Billy!" I shouted.
Too late. The other boy walked up to Billy and hit him. And there was Billy, on his back.
Geroge was very angry. "Billy Elliot, you're the worst boxer in this club! Bring mefifty pence for the lesson."
I couldn't look at Billy. I was so angry. What can I do for that boy? If he can't fight a fat boy, what can he do?
