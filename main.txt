Billy Elliot is a film by Stephen Daldry, starring Jamie Bell as BIlly, Gary Lewis as his father and Julie Walters as Mrs Wilkinson. The film was written by Lee Hall, and then rewritten as a book by Melvin Burgess.
The story begins in 1984, when many British workers were fighting the government. Margaret Thtcher's government wanted to close a lot of coal mines in England, Wales and Scotland. The miners wanted to keep their jobs. Some went on strike and refused to work. Other workers continued to do their jobs. The government had to send the police to protect them. The strike continued for a long time before everybody went back to work. But a few years later, nearly all the coal mines in the UK were closed and thousands of workers lost their jobs.
Billy Elliot was a very successful film in many contries across the world. It is now also a musical play, with songs by Sir Elton John.

Chapter 1 BIlly's Story: Family Life
My brother Tony is stupid, but he likes good music. I listen to his records before school when he and my dad are out on the picket line. My grandmother - we call her Nan - likes the music too. I play the music and she sits in bed and sings. Sometimes we dance around the room She's nearly eighty and she can't walk far. But she lifts her arms up in the air and tries to stand on one leg like a ballet dancer.
Dad and Tony don't like it when she dances. They think it's stupid. But I want her to dance and sing all day.
This morning I made her breakfast and danced into her room.
"Hey, Nan, it's the dancing waiter," I said.
But she wasn't there!
I ran out of the door. My dad will kill me if I lose Nan. I raced up the road shouting, "Nan! Nan!"
Where was she? Was she on her way down to the sea? You can see the sea from our house and she goes there sopmetimes. But little Alison, one of the neighbour's children, pointed up the street.
Suddenly I knew: Nan was in the field under the railway bridge. She often goes there. Nobody knows why. Maybe she played there when she was a child.
"Nan!" I shouted.
She turned and looked at me. I pused through the long wet grass. Poor Nan, she was wet and frightened.
"I don't know where I am," she said.
"Don't you want your eggs?" I said.
"You're new," she said.
"Nan, it's Billy. Billy."
Three vans stopped near the railway bridge and lots of policemen climbed out. Theyfrightened me. Nan looked at them.
